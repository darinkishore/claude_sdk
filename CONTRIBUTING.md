## Development Process

### Setting Up Your Environment

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/claude-sdk
cd claude-sdk

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/originalrepo/claude-sdk

# Create a virtual environment (Python)
cd python
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install development dependencies
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Build the Rust extension
uv run maturin develop
```

### Code Style

#### Rust
- Follow standard Rust conventions
- Use `cargo fmt` before committing
- Run `cargo clippy` and address warnings
- Add documentation comments for public APIs

#### Python
- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints for all public functions
- Add docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Run `ruff` for linting and formatting

### Testing

#### Running Tests

```bash
# Rust tests
cargo test

# Python tests
cd python
uv run pytest

# Integration tests (requires Claude CLI)
cargo test --test t1_integration_test -- --ignored --nocapture
```

#### Writing Tests

- Add unit tests for new functionality
- Include integration tests for major features
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Ensure tests are deterministic

### Documentation

- Update README.md if you change functionality
- Update inline documentation
- Add examples for new features
- Update CHANGELOG.md

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Example:
```
Add session export functionality

- Implement JSON, CSV, and Markdown export formats
- Add command-line flags for format selection
- Include comprehensive tests for all formats

Fixes #123
```
